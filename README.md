# 🏗️ BI Dashboard for Competitor Project Analysis in the Construction Industry

> *"Your only limit is the one you set for yourself."*  
> This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and compare a construction company's projects against its competitors using Power BI. The goal was to provide actionable insights into cost efficiency, timelines, resource utilization, and competitive advantages.

## 🎯 Overview

This **Power BI dashboard** was developed to help a construction company monitor and analyze its projects compared to its competitors. It enables users to:
- Compare key metrics such as project costs, timelines, and resource utilization.
- Identify areas where the company has a competitive advantage.
- Evaluate internal project performance across active projects.
- Provide strategic recommendations for optimizing costs, timelines, and resource allocations.

The dashboard covers four main sections:
1. **Competitor Overview Dashboard**
2. **Internal Project Analysis**
3. **Competitor Deep Dive**
4. **Strategic Opportunity Analysis**
